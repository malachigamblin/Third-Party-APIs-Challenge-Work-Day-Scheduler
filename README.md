# Work-Day-Scheduler-Challenge

## Description

The Ohio State University Coding Boot Camp assigned a homework project to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day.

## Features

• The app features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

• To store user input history, localStorage is used, and if any input exists in local storage, it  is displayed when the website first loads.

• Moment.js is used to display the current time.

• The cards change color based on the time displayed being past, present, or future.

• Bootstrap and CSS are utilized for styling.

• The UI is clean and straightforward.
 
## Usage

Upon opening the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. Users can scroll down to see time blocks for standard business hours, and each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it's in the past, present, or future. Users can enter an event by clicking on a time block and save it by clicking the save button, which saves the text for that event in local storage. The saved events persist even after the page is refreshed.
