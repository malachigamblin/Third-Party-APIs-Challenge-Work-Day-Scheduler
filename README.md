# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Description
Utilizing jQuery, Bootstrap, and Moment.js, this app empowers you to plan your work day effectively. You can create a schedule for each hour, and the app will indicate the current time by color-coding each hour as past, present, or future. To modify a specific timeblock, simply click on the corresponding textarea and enter your schedule for the hour. Once you've finished, save your changes by clicking the save icon, and all the information you entered will be stored locally for future use.
